# a brief description that explains my regex pattern 

I came up with a regex pattern that validates a mastercard, having to start with "5155", followed by other random 12 numbers between "0-9", all having a total of 16 digits.

Any input contrary to my description in the line prior to this, would through an invalid response (false), as passed in my code.
